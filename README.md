### oci-tool

The [oci-cli](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli) is a great tool for accessing your
tenancy and doing all those things you may want to do for your infrastructure. There
are some things that are really annoying to do. Like get all the instances in your
tenancy with their private and public (if available) ip addresses. This tool hopes
to make those sorts of tasks more simple.
